# AE 370 Rocket Trajectory Simulator

This project is a 2DOF physics-based rocket simulator built in Python, developed for the AE 370 course. It models the vertical flight of a rocket using time-dependent thrust curves, atmospheric effects, and aerodynamic drag, with numerical integration performed via the 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method.

## Features

- Interactive launch interface with `ipywidgets`
- Real motor thrust curve support via CSV import
- RK4-based trajectory integration with mass depletion and drag
- Output includes velocity, altitude, dynamic pressure, Mach number, energy, and more
- Built-in plotting for all key flight parameters
- Convergence and stability analysis tools to validate numerical accuracy

## How It Works

1. The user selects a motor and inputs rocket parameters through a Jupyter interface.
2. Thrust data is interpolated from `.csv` files in the `motors/` folder.
3. The simulation calculates forces and updates rocket state via RK4.
4. Plots are generated to visualize time evolution of physical quantities.
